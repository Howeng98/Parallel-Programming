# Parallel Programming
National Tsing Hua University - CS 542200 Course's Instructor: Jerry Chou.

This repository includes all labs and homeworks covering MPI, OpenMP, Pthread and CUDA.

In time template directory, I provide some tools for you to calculate IO, CPU and Compute time. Besides, I also provide some tools for you to draw the bar and line graph.

## Lab1
- Lab1 needs you to calculate how many pixels in a circle in order to make you get familar with MPI usage.
- scoreboard rank: 3/54

## HW1
- HW1 needs you to implement odd-even sort with MPI.
- scoreboard rank: 5/49

## Lab2
There are three labs this time including Pthread, OpenMP and hybrid of MPI and OpenMP.

These three labs require you to do the same problem as the lab1 to calculate how many pixels in a circle.
