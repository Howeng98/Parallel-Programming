# Parallel Programming
National Tsing Hua University - CS 542200 Course's Instructor: Jerry Chou.

This repository includes all labs and homeworks covering MPI, OpenMP, Pthread and CUDA.

I provide some template tools for you to calculate IO, CPU and Compute time. Besides, I also provide some tools for you to draw the bar and line graph.

## Lab1
- Lab1 needs you to calculate how many pixels in a circle in order to make you get familar with MPI usage.
- Scoreboard Rank: 3/54

## HW1
- HW1 needs you to implement odd-even sort with MPI.
- Scoreboard Rank: 4/49
- [Result](./hw1/README.md)

## Lab2
- There are three labs this time including Pthread, OpenMP and hybrid of MPI and OpenMP.
- These three labs require you to do the same problem as the lab1 to calculate how many pixels in a circle.
- Scoreboard rank (Pthread): 4/48
- Scoreboard rank (OpenMP): 3/47
- Scoreboard rank (OpenMP+MPI): 2/48

## HW2
- HW2 needs you implement mandelbrot set with Pthread and hybrid of MPI and OpenMP.
- Scoreboard rank (Pthread): 2/47
- Scoreboard rank (OpenMP+MPI): 2/47
- [Result](./hw2/README.md)

## Lab3 && Lab4
- Lab3 needs you to calculate Sobel of the images with CUDA.
- [Lab3 Result](./lab3/README.md)
- Lab4 needs you optimize kernel calculation.
- [Lab4 Solution](./lab4/README.md)

## HW3
- HW3 needs you to implement All-Pairs-Shortest-Path with multiple threads, single GPU and multiple GPU
- [HW3 optimization skill](./hw3/README.md)
- Scoreboard rank (multiple threads): 13/41
- Scoreboard rank (Single GPU): 7/40
- Scoreboard rank (Multiple GPU): 2/40
